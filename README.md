# tic-tac-toe
This is tic tac toe game with flexible game-board size.

The highlight about this game:  
1. It will take user input for board size >= 3, i.e. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 etc.
2. It will ask for player's marker ('X' or 'O').
3. Board will be displayed after any change on board.
4. It will display available cells on board for a player to enter and update player's input on board.
5. After every input by a player, it will check for winner/tie.  
   If there is winner/tie, it will ask player whether they will play  
   another round of game. If there is neither winner nor tie, the game  
   will ask next player to enter a cell from available cells.
6. All inputs by a player are validated before processing, in case of  
   invalid player input, it will give option to re-enter valid data. 

Python version 3.9.16 is used for this project.
